# The Xopak System
The Xopak System, inspired by my own system of creation, is a planetary system pack that includes 30 bodies, including 14 planets, 15 moons, and one comet. The system is primarily set light years away, but scaled down from 50 light years to 4.55 light years in 1/11 scale, or 43,000,000,000,000 Kilometers away from Kerbol in-game.

This mod is in active development, and will be updated as soon as I have the time to.

# Features
This planet pack includes a variety of worlds, from a world melting near the star, to a binary dwarf system cold and far. With many planets to explore, there is unique opportunities to encounter, and even a few secrets to uncover...
